# gcno_dumper

This project is intended to be a part of RTEMS-TOOLS repository
maintained by THE RTEMS PROJECT.
https://github.com/RTEMS/rtems-tools

The motivation behind this dumper project is to add gcov support in
the `covoar` tool used by  RTEMS for it's coverage analysis.  
This is an attempt to understand the contents of the gcno files
and to provide a tool that will help debug the coverage reports 
by dumping the contents of the gcno files in human readable txt 
format.

Do have a look at my development blog where I have written about 
the project and the generated txt file is detail. :)
